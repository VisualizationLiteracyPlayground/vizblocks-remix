## Description

The project uses [Remix](https://remix.run/), which is a full stack web framework that lets you focus on the user interface and work back through web fundamentals to deliver a fast, slick, and resilient user experience.
It includes `@mui/material` and its peer dependencies, including `emotion`, the default style engine in MUI v5.
